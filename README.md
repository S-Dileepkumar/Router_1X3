# Router_1X3
This Repository is about the project 1x3 router rtl and verification 

The 1x3 Router project is a classic VLSI design exercise commonly used to simulate basic on-chip communication logic. It routes data packets from a single input interface to one of three output ports based on the destination field in the packet's header. Each packet typically includes a header (e.g., 2-bit destination address) and payload. The router inspects this header and forwards the packet to the appropriate output. This is a simplified model of what is used in larger Network-on-Chip (NoC) or interconnect systems inside SoCs. It serves as a practical and modular starting point to understand synchronous logic design, packet switching, and arbitration mechanisms.

From an RTL perspective, the design involves modules such as a decoder, an output port controller, internal multiplexers (or crossbar logic), and optional input buffering using flip-flops or FIFOs. The core logic decodes the destination address and activates the correct output channel while ensuring that only one path is active at a time. Control FSMs manage valid/ready signals for handshake-based data transfers. This router operates in a clocked environment, designed in Verilog or SystemVerilog, and follows best practices for parameterization and modular design.

For verification, a structured testbench is developed, ideally using SystemVerilog and UVM methodology. The verification plan covers directed and random packet injections to ensure proper routing. Functional coverage is implemented to track destination address combinations, packet sizes, and port utilization scenarios. Code coverage tools (like Synopsys VCS or Mentor Questa) are used to evaluate line, toggle, branch, and FSM coverage. A scoreboard is implemented to match expected versus actual output, and monitors are used to capture bus activity and measure coverage metrics. Test regressions are automated using Python or shell scripts to run across multiple seeds and configurations.
